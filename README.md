Within the files you will find an .xlsx file with multiple sheets. The first one is the original database, followed by the resulting data after the edits. 

# For this project I used Excel and Pyhton (Jupyter Notebook). 

After the cleaning of our data the result is two beautiful Dashboards that help us understand the Data better.


## The first Dashboard shows us a total overview of the Financial situation of the products. 
I have based the final results on the ability to utilize slicers, to determine the best strategy for a new seller on wish.

## The second Dashboard is dedicated to the analysis of 'tags' on each of the products. 
Using slicers, we can determine which were the most successful tags for category of products selected.
